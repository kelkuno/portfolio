            <h3>Project Duration: 2 weeks!</h3>
            <h3>Application Overview:</h3>
            <p>Color is a critical tool for artists and designers. We are surrounded by interesting color combinations all of the time. I might notice a cool color combination in a pattern on someone's shirt or displayed on a package logo or in a piece of artwork. I might go for a walk and see a striking scene in nature with a great color palette. Color inspirations are everywhere but if we donâ€™t have a way to record and save them, then we won't remember them. </p>
            <p>My app will generate color palettes from photos that users upload. The idea is a user will upload a photo and the app will generate colors in the photo so that the user can store and access the palette later on. </p>
            <p>Being that I am an artist myself, I spent a lot of time thinking about the application flow. Here's a rough wireframe of how I imagined the flow:</p>
